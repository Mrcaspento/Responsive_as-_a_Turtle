# Responsive_as_a_Turtle
 This is my biggest work yet, I will continue to add to it and updating it as the class goes on. I struggled with the containers in my portfolio and the layout of the grid unitl i was almost doen i finally understood how it worked. what helped me was setting the background of the "col" and "row" with bg-light so i can actually visably see it.
